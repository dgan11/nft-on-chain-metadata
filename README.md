# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Open terminal
Initialize a new Git repository: git init

Stage your files before first commit: git add.

Commit the files: git commit -m “Project started”

Add remote repository: git remote add origin **URL**

Verify the remote repository: git remote -v

Push the first changes: git push -u origin master
